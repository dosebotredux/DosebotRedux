// If you're reading this comment, you're looking for a bit more information
// than the command gives. Without going into too much detail, Cocoa and I had
// a falling out and haven't spoken since November of 2018. In November of 2019,
// we lost Cocoa. I'm not sure what happened. Cocoa and I were not friends when
// they died, but I respect their effort to learn JavaScript and create harm
// reduction resources, and DoseBot would not be here if it weren't for their
// effort. It's tragic that they left us before unleashing their full potential
// upon the world, which Cocoa was just beginning to unlock.
//
// To Cocoa's loved ones: I hope you can find comfort in these dark times. If I
// can be of any help, you know how to reach me.
